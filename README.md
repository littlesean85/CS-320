# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? 
  To ensure everything is safe and secure, I can make sure to run the testig programs, and make sure they go through wihtout any errors.  Also it is beneficial to get a second pair of eyes on it, to make sure it is accurate as far as coding is concerned.  The testing aspect if it are where we would find out if the program would be functional. 
  
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  The client would give us potential user needs and what they want in the program, and that is what we would base our inital work off of for programming purposes. ONce we have that set and we launch programs, we can load in surveys for actual users to see if they have suggestions for improvements for the actual use of the program. 
  
# How do I approach designing software?
  I approach it head on.  Meaning I start at the beginning and move from there.  The first intial thing would be working wiht the client and having a conversation about what they would like in their program.  After we collect that data, we break in down into diagrams and planning boards.  Then we start with the coding and testing. Then after that is coplete we would bring it to the client.  When it comes to designing software I have found it is easier to work through and break down when we have UML diagrams to follow.
